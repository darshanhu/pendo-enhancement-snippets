# Pendo Enhancement Snippets
 This library of custom code snippets has been built by Darshan with AI support, intended to extend the capabilities of Pendo products.

# Guides
 This repository contains custom HTML/CSS/JS snippets that can be used to extend the functionality of Pendo Guides. All code, unless otherwise stated, should be inserted into a Custom Code Building Block within a guide in the Pendo Visual Design Studio. The vast majority of these snippets apply only to the Visual Design Studio, as opposed to the legacy Classic Designer.
